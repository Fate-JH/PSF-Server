  * The server instructs clients to render a certain avatar not operated by its player to move in a certain way.<br>
  * <br>
  * The avatar model normally moves from where it currently is to `pos`.
  * When `vel` is defined, `pos` is treated as where the avatar model starts its animation;
  * and, from there, it moves a certain distance as according to the values.
  * The repositioning always takes the same amount of time and the player model is left in running animation (in place).
  * The coordinates evaluate between -256.0 and 256.0.<br>

There is a bool that is currently unhandled that determines if the packet is aware that this code would run.
If it passes, the first 8-bit value is the number of times the data will be iterated over.
On each pass, a 4-bit value is extracted from the packet and compared against 15.
When 15 is read, an 8-bit value is read on that same turn.
On each subsequent turn, 8-bit values will be read until the number of iterations or there is an exception.
